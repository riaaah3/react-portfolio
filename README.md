# react-portfolio

## Description

This is my professional portfolio, made with react. 
This portfolio was created to be not only a way to showcase some of my abilities creating this application, 
but to also demonstrate some of my other projects as well.
The projects included in this portfolio were made using some key Fullstack Development skills, two core ones being JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
Other technologies used are Express.js, Third-Party APIs, and Progressive Web Applications.
This portfolio is not the full extent of my abilities.
Please check my Github profile to get a better glimpse at my web developing abilities.
